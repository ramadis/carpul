## Comments

- A user can't search for his/her own trips
- The earnings for a trip you own are calculated taking into account the amount of people registered for a trip and the cost per passenger. (# passengers with reservations \* cost per passenger)
- Trips are only reviewable after the arrival time. And after the departure time they are disabled (for both drivers and passengers.)
